## Assignment Overview

### Task
I'm excited to tackle the frontend development of a web application using React, Vite, and TypeScript, or alternatively, HTML/CSS/Responsive/jQuery/JavaScript based on the provided Figma UI/UX Design file. The goal is to convert the design into functional components and ensure responsiveness across devices.
